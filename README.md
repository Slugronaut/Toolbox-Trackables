# Toolbox-Trackables
Components for tracking and averaging multiple object positions.

It was originally designed for use in an over-head camera system to keep the camera centered on all players and any other important key objects. Cinemachine has more-or-less replaced all functionality here but it might have uses outside of that where camera aren't specficially needed.
